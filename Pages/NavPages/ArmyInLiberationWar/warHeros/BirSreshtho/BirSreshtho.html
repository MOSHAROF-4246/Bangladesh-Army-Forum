          <h3 style="text-align: center;">Hamidur Rahman</h3>

          <div class="bir-details">
            <p>Hamidur Rahman was born on 2 February 1953 in Khardo Khalishpur village under Moheshpur police station of the Jhenaidah district, and was the eldest son of his family. During the Partition of India in 1947, his paternal properties fell in India. They crossed over the border and settled in the bordering area of Khorda Khalishpur of Jhenaidah district.</p>
            <p>He joined East Bengal Regiment on 2 February 1971 and participated in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. During the war he made a significant contribution in capturing the Dhalai Border Outpost at Srimangal. Though the independence fighters came very close to the Border Outpost, it became very difficult to capture owing to the enemy machine gun which was continuously firing from the south-western corner of the Dhalai Border Outpost.[citation needed] On 28 October 1971, a battle was taking place between 1st East Bengal Regiment and 30 A Frontier Force Regiment in Dhalai of Sylhet. 125 members of the East Bengal Regiment decided to use grenades on the machine gun posts of the Pakistani army. Rahman took the responsibility of throwing grenades, and crawled through the hilly canals. He managed to throw two grenades before he was shot.[1] Hamidur Rahman jumped into the enemy machine gun post and engaged in hand to hand fighting with the two crews who were guarding the gun, and at one point neutralized the gun.[1] Realizing the fact that the machine gun outpost was damaged, the EBR's approach towards the enemy captured their first line within a short period of time. After the capture of the Dhalai Border Outpost, members of the EBR found the dead body of Rahman.[1] Sepoy Hamidur Rahman's efforts helped the East Bengal Regiment take the outpost. He was buried in Tripura in India. On 27 October 2007, advisers of the Bangladeshi caretaker government decided to bring back his remains to Bangladesh and bury him besides Bir Shrestho Matiur Rahman. It is said[by whom?] that the last place he stood alive was about 20 feet away from the Pakistani bunker, either in a canal or where the memorial is (near the bunker).[2] 10 December 2007 the remains of Hamidur Rahman were bought back to Bangladesh and on 11 December 2007 he was buried again at Buddhijibi Koborsthan (Cemetery), Dhaka.[3]</p>
            <p>For the courage, valour, dedication to the cause of his motherland and supreme sacrifice, he was conferred Bir Sreshtho by the nation of Bangladesh.</p>

His father, Habibur Rahman was a Havilder.On 18 April 1971, Mustafa Kamal was killed in a defensive battle against the occupying Pakistan Army in Daruin village of Comilla. His actions inflicted heavy casualties on his enemy troops.He was awarded the highest recognition of bravery of the Bangladesh Army, Bir Sreshtho.</p>

After the incidents of 25 March, 4th Regiment successfully brought Brahmanbaria under control. Under the leadership of Major Shafayat Jamil, they revolted against the Pakistani officers and formed a Defence Camp at Brahmanbaria. 4th Regiment continued their battle against the Pakistan Army and eventually arrived at Aakhaura. At Aakhaura, the 4th Regiment set their camp in Gangashagar and Talshahar. To avoid any unexpected attacked from the Pakistanis, 2nd Platoon of the company "Alpha" was sent to Daruin village. Mostafa Kamal was one of the section commanders of 2nd Platoon.</p>

            <p>On 16 April, Pakistan Army started to approach towards the Regiment camp. They were coming over the railway of the Comilla-Aakhaura root. Regiment also reconciled their position at Daruin. They settled on their trenches near a pond. Mostafa Kamal took the rightmost position.</p>

            <p>On 17 April, Pakistanis opened fire. Major Shafayat Jamil strengthened his force by sending the 11th Platoon of company Delta to Daruin. At around 12 PM the Pakistanis attacked from West. Another part of the Pakistan Army attacked Mukti Bahini from behind. As a result, Regiment had decided to retreat from Daruin. Mostafa Kamal took the responsibly to cover for his fellow fighters. Most of the fighters retreated to a safer position as Kamal relentlessly kept firing with his Light Machine Gun. He managed to neutralize(kill) 8 Pakistani soldiers. But at one stage, he got shot. He along with 20 to 40 other soldiers died at this battle.</p>

He was buried at the Martyred Intellectuals Graveyard, in Mirpur, Dhaka, with full military honours.[1] His original burial in a nondescript grave in Pakistan had been a sore point between Bangladesh and Pakistan for decades.</p>

          <div class="bir-details">
            <p>Munshi Abdur Rouf (1 May 1943 – 1971) was a Lance Nayek in East Pakistan Rifles during the Bangladesh Liberation War. He enlisted in the East Bengal Regiment on 8 May 1963, and was attached with a regular infantry unit during War of Liberation. Munshi Abdur Rouf embraced martyrdom on 18 April 1971 at Burighat in Chittagong Hill Tracts after causing extensive damage to Pakistan Army with his MG and forcing them to retreat. He was buried at Naniarchor Upazilla in Rangamati District.</p>

            <p>He was awarded Bir Sreshtho, which is the highest recognition of bravery in Bangladesh.</p>

            <p>Early Life</p>

            <p>In order to prevent the Pakistan Army from utilizing the Rangamati-Mahalchari waterway, 8th East Bengal Regiment constructed a camp at both sides. On 18 April 1971, Pakistan Army attacked at the defense position of Mukti Bahini with 7 speed boats and 2 launches. Their mission was to drive the Mukti Bahini away from the waterway of Rangamati and Mohalchari. Pakistani forces managed to disorient Mukti Bahini by coming closer to them and firing heavily. In the meantime Pakistanis surrounded the freedom fighters and managed to isolate nearly 100 of them. Rouf realized the threat to the entire company. So, he crawled forward to his trench and continuously fired towards the enemies with his automatic machine gun. As a result, Pakistanis dragged their launches back to a safer place and resumed their firing from there. Suddenly a mortar directly hit Rouf and he died immediately. Munshi Abdur Rouf's valiant effort helped his company to survive as his act saved nearly 150 soldiers of the Mukti Bahini on that day.</p>

              Battle of Goalhati</p>
              <p>Lance Nayek Nur Mohammad was selected as the captain of the Standing Patrol team at Goalhati that was established to monitor the Pakistan army. On 5 September, Nur Mohammad was patrolling with 4 fellow soldiers. The Pakistan army managed to point out the position of Nur Mohammad's team and attacked them from three different sides. Nur Mohammad wanted to retreat to his base and continued to fire towards Pakistani armies. Meanwhile, one of his fellow soldiers was shot by a bullet and Nur Mohammad started carrying him towards safety. But Nur Mohammad himself was hit by a mortar. Even though he was seriously injured, Nur Mohammad decided to continue to provide covering fire for his team. At the time, his fellow Sepoy, Mostafa, urged Nur Mohammad to go with him. Mostafa even tried to force Nur Mohammad to go but Nur Mohammad refused to go but gave his Light Machine Gun to Mostafa so that it would not be captured after his death. He kept a self loaded rifle with him and kept on fighting until he died.</p>
              <p>He was posthumously awarded the highest gallantry award "Bir Shrestho" for his bravery during the War of Liberation.</p>
